# Embedded-System-Project-Temperature-Monitoring-and-Motor-Control
This project implements a temperature-controlled LED system and motor control unit using a PIC16F877A microcontroller. An LM35 sensor monitors temperature and triggers LED indicators, while an L293D motor driver enables motor control based on button inputs.
